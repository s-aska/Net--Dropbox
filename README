Net::Dropbox::API
=================

Net::Dropbox::API is a perl interface to the Dropbox API. Find details about
the Dropbox API on: https://www.dropbox.com/developers

The Dropbox API is a OAuth based API. I try to abstract as much away as
possible so you should not need to know too much about it.  This is how
it works:

   use Net::Dropbox::API;

   my $box = Net::Dropbox::API->new({key => 'KEY', secret => 'SECRET'});
   my $login_link = $box->login; # user needs to click this link and login
   $box->auth;                   # oauth keys get exchanged
   my $info = $box->info;        # and here we have our account info

See the examples for a working Mojolicious web client using the Dropbox
API.
